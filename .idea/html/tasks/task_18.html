        In the early 1950s, each computer design was unique. There were no upward-compatible
        machines or computer architectures with multiple, differing implementations. Programs
        written for one machine would run on no other kind, even other kinds from the same company.
        This was not a major drawback then because no large body of software had been developed to run
        on computers, so starting programming from scratch was not seen as a large barrier. The design
        freedom of the time was very important because designers were very constrained by the cost of
        electronics, and only starting to explore how a computer could best be organized. Some of the
        basic features introduced during this period included index registers (on the Ferranti Mark 1),
        a return address saving instruction (UNIVAC I), immediate operands (IBM 704), and detecting
        invalid operations (IBM 650). By the end of the 1950s, commercial builders had developed
        factory-constructed, truck-deliverable computers. The most widely installed computer was
        the IBM 650, which used drum memory onto which programs were loaded using either paper punched
        tape or punched cards. Some very high-end machines also included core memory which provided
        higher speeds. Hard disks were also starting to grow popular. A computer is an automatic abacus.
        The type of number system affects the way it works. In the early 1950s, most computers were
        built for specific numerical processing tasks, and many machines used decimal numbers as
        their basic number system; that is, the mathematical functions of the machines worked in base-10
        instead of base-2 as is common today. These were not merely binary-coded decimal (BCD).
        Most machines had ten vacuum tubes per digit in each processor register. Some early Soviet computer
        designers implemented systems based on ternary logic; that is, a bit could have three states:
        +1, 0, or -1, corresponding to positive, zero, or negative voltage. </div>

            A graphics card (also called a video card, display card, graphics adapter,
            VGA card/VGA, video adapter, display adapter, or colloquially GPU) is a computer
            expansion card that generates a feed of graphics output to a display device such as a monitor.
            Graphics cards are sometimes called discrete or dedicated graphics cards to emphasize their distinction
            to integrated graphics processor on the motherboard or the CPU. A graphics processing unit (GPU)
            that performs the necessary computations is the main component in a graphics card, but the acronym "GPU"
            is sometimes also used to erroneously refer to the graphics card as a whole. Most graphics cards are not
            limited to simple display output. The graphics processing unit can be used for additional processing,
            which reduces the load from the central processing unit.[2] Additionally, computing platforms such as OpenCL
            and CUDA allow using graphics cards for general-purpose computing. Applications of general-purpose computing
            on graphics cards include AI training, cryptocurrency mining, and molecular simulation. Usually,
            a graphics card comes in the form of a printed circuit board (expansion board) which is to be inserted
            into an expansion slot. Others may have dedicated enclosures, and they are connected to the computer
            via a docking station or a cable. These are known as external GPUs (eGPUs). Graphics cards are often
            preferred over integrated graphics for increased performance.
